## Summary

The **Store Front Template** is an individually created, full-stack project made to solidify my understanding of several full-stack development principles. This project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and the Fetch API to present an interactive UI for the user. Products and the shopping cart are stored on the back-end using MySQL, Java and Spring MVC. The idea for this project was drawn from a Webflow example located at: https://store-starter-template.webflow.io/
